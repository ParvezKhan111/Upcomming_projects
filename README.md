Putting It All Together: A Sample Weekly Roadmap
(These numbers are based on sequential work—feel free to adjust or work on multiple projects concurrently.)

Weeks 1–4 (20+ workdays):
Focus on Beginner Web & App Projects (roughly 40 days total). You might choose 2–3 smaller projects concurrently if you have overlapping tech stacks.

Weeks 5–10 (40–50 workdays):
Work on Intermediate Web & App Projects.

Weeks 11–14 (40 days):
Tackle the Advanced / AI-Integrated Projects.

Weeks 15–30 (80+ workdays):
Dive into the Machine Learning Projects.
Tip: You may start with the Beginner ML set before moving on to Intermediate and then Advanced/Expert ML challenges.

Weeks 31–38 (50–60 workdays):
Complete the Blockchain Projects.

Overall:
The cumulative estimated workdays (if done one after the other) sum up to around 400+ days.

This roadmap is ambitious and assumes full-time focus on project development. In reality, you might:

Work on projects concurrently (especially if they share technologies).
Reuse components or libraries to speed up development.
Adjust durations based on how familiar you are with the tech stack.

Tips for Efficiency
Leverage Reusability: Once you set up your project structure (e.g., authentication, database integration), use those frameworks across similar projects.
Document & Refactor: Maintain good documentation as you progress; it’ll make revisiting similar projects easier.
Set Milestones: Define clear MVP (Minimum Viable Product) goals for each project. You can always add extra features later.
Regular Reviews: At the end of each week, review progress and adjust time estimates if needed.
